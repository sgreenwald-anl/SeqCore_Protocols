Genomic DNA was amplified using an ITS barcoded primer set, adapted for the Illumina HiSeq2000 and MiSeq. These primers were designed by Kabir Peay’s lab at Stanford University (1). The reverse amplification primer also contained a twelve base barcode sequence that supports pooling of up to 2,167 different samples in each lane (2,3). Each 25 µL PCR reaction contains 9.5 µL of PCR Water (Certified DNA-Free), 12.5 µL of New England Biosystem’s LongAmp® Hot Start Taq 2X Master Mix, 1 µL Golay barcode tagged Forward Primer (5 µM concentration, 200 pM final), 1 µL Reverse Primer (5 µM concentration, 200 pM final), and 1 µL of template DNA. The conditions for PCR are also follows: 94°C for 3 minutes to denature the DNA, with 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 90 s; with a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C to ensure complete amplification. Amplicons were quantified using PicoGreen (Invitrogen) and a plate reader. Once quantified, different volumes of each of the products are pooled into a single tube so that each amplicon is represented equally. This pool is then cleaned up using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter), and then quantified using a fluorometer (Qubit, Invitrogen). After quantification, the molarity of the pool is determined and diluted down to 2nM, denatured, and then diluted to a final concentration of 6.75pM with a 10% PhiX spike for 2x251bp sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq.
