Protocol for AMF amplicon library preparation and sequencing

Briefly, PCR amplicon libraries targeting NS31/aML2 of Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) 
using a barcoded primer set adapted for the Illumina Nextseq 2000 and MiSeq (1,2). DNA sequence data is then generated using Illumina paired-end sequencing at the Environmental Sample Preparation and Sequencing Facility (ESPSF) at Argonne National Laboratory. NS31/aML2 is PCR amplified with region-specific primers that include sequencer adapter sequences used in the Illumina flowcell (2).  The reverse amplification primer also contains a twelve base barcode sequence that supports pooling of up to 2,167 different samples in each lane (1,2). Primers and primer constructs were designed by Benjami Morgan (2017).

Each 25 µL PCR reaction contains 9.5 µL of PCR Water (Certified DNA-Free), 12.5 µL of New England Biosystem’s LongAmp® Hot Start Taq 2X Master Mix, 1 µL Golay barcode tagged reverse primer (5 µM concentration, 200 pM final), 1 µL forward Primer (5 µM concentration, 200 pM final), and 1 µL of template DNA. The conditions for PCR are as follows: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94°C; followed by 35 cycles of 45 s at 94°C (denaturation), 60 s at 63.1°C (annealing), and 90 s at 72°C (extension); followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 72°C to ensure complete amplification. Amplicons are then quantified using PicoGreen (Invitrogen) and a plate reader (Infinite 200 PRO, Tecan). Once quantified, volumes of each of the products are pooled into a single tube so that each amplicon is represented in equimolar amounts. This pool is then cleaned up using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter), and then quantified using a fluorometer (Qubit, Invitrogen). After quantification, the molarity of the pool is determined and diluted down to 2 nM, denatured, and then diluted to a final concentration of 6.75 pM with a 10% PhiX spike for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. Amplicons are sequenced on a 301bp x 12bp x 301bp MiSeq run using customized sequencing primers and procedures (1,2).
