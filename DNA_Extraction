1. BEFORE THE FIRST USE ONLY, Solution C5-D must be prepared.  Add an equal amount of 100% Ethanol to Solution C5-D (for the 4 prep kit = 120 ml, or for the 12 prep kit = 360 ml). Mix well.  Put a check mark in the “ethanol added” box on the bottle cap label.

2. Centrifuge Bead Plate for 1 min at 2500 x g to pellet the beads. Remove the Square Well Mat from the PowerSoil®-htp Bead Plate and set aside.  Add 0.1 to 0.25 grams of soil sample.  

Note: This is an appropriate stopping point and you can store the PowerSoil®-htp Bead Plate at 4°C covered with the Square Well Mat. This is the most time consuming step of the protocol. Care must be taken to avoid cross contamination between sample wells. 

3. Add 750 µl of PowerSoil®-htp Bead Solution to the wells of the PowerSoil®-htp Bead Plate.

4. Check Solution C1. If Solution C1 has precipitated, heat solution at 60°C until the precipitate has dissolved.  

Note: Solution C1 contains SDS. If it gets cold, it will precipitate. Heating at 60°C will dissolve the SDS. Solution C1 can be used while it is still warm.

5. Add 60 µl of Solution C1. Secure the Square Well Mat (from step 2) tightly to the plate. Place sealed plates in 65°C water bath for 20 min. DO NOT SUBMERGE THE PLATES.

6. Place PowerSoil®-htp Bead Plate with Aluminum plates and Black Square Well Mats securely fastened to the 96 Well Plate Shaker. 

Note: The final order of assembly is; Aluminum Plate, Black Square Well Mat, 96 Well PowerSoil®-htp Plate, Black Square Well Mat and second Aluminum Plate.  

7. Shake at speed 20 for 20 minutes. 

8. Centrifuge at room temperature for 30 minutes at 2500 x g.

a. While centrifuging, aliquot 250 µl of Solution C2 into each well of Plate #1 and cover with Sealing Tape. The Sealing Tape can be re-used when centrifuging Plate #1 in step 11 if handled carefully.

9. Remove and discard the Square Well Mat from the Bead Plate.
 
10. Carefully remove the Sealing Tape from Plate #1 and transfer the supernatant (~ 400-500μl) from the Bead Plate to Plate #1. 

Note: The supernatant may still contain some soil particles.

11. Re-apply the Sealing Tape to Plate #1. Vortex for 5 seconds and incubate at 4°C for 10 minutes. Centrifuge Plate #1 at room temperature for 10 minutes at 2500 x g. 

a. While centrifuging, aliquot 200 µl Solution C3 into each well of Plate #3, then cover with Sealing Tape. The Sealing Tape can be re-used when centrifuging Plate #3 in step 13 if handled carefully.

12. After centrifugation, carefully remove and discard Sealing Tape from Plate #1. 

13. Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume (~600 μl depending on sample type) of supernatant in Plate #1 to Plate #2. 

14. Apply Sealing Tape to Plate #2 and centrifuge at room temperature for 10 minutes at 2500 x g.  

15. Carefully remove Sealing Tape from Plate #2 and Plate #3. Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant (~600 μl) from Plate #2 to Plate #3. 

16. Re-apply Sealing Tape to Plate #3. Vortex for 5 seconds and incubate at 4°C for 
10 minutes.  Centrifuge at room temperature for 10 minutes at 2500 x g.  

17. Carefully remove and discard Sealing Tape from Plate #3. Avoiding the pellet, transfer the entire volume of supernatant (~750 μl) to Plate #4. 

18. Apply Sealing Tape to Plate #4 and centrifuge at room temperature for 10 minutes at 2500 x g. 

a. While centrifuging, add 650 µl of Solution C4 to Plate #5.

19. Avoiding any residual pellet, transfer up to 650 µl of supernatant in Plate #4 to Plate #5. 

20. Add a second 650 µl (1300 µl C4 total) aliquot of Solution C4 to each well of Plate #5.

Note:  It is safe to stop the protocol at this step and store the samples covered with Sealing Tape at 4°C. Make sure to briefly centrifuge the plate to collect any condensate on the plate seal after overnight storage.

21. Pipet samples “up and down” to mix. 

22. Place Spin Plate onto Plate #6.

23. Load approximately 650 µl from Plate #5 into each well of the Spin Plate and apply Centrifuge Tape.

24. Centrifuge at room temperature for 5 minutes at 2500 x g. Discard the flow through and place the Spin Plate back on Plate #6.  Carefully remove and discard the Centrifuge Tape.

25. Repeat steps 23-24 until all the supernatant has been processed.  Discard the final flow through.

26. Place the Spin Plate back on Plate #6.  

27. Confirm that ethanol has been added to Solution C5-D (see step 1).  Add 500 µl of Solution C5-D to each well of the Spin Plate.  Apply Centrifuge Tape to the Spin Plate.

28. Centrifuge at room temperature for 5 minutes at 2500 x g. Discard the flow through and place the Spin Plate back on Plate #6.

29. Centrifuge again at room temperature for 10 minutes at 2500 x g. Discard the flow through.

30. Carefully place the Spin Plate onto the Microplate.  Remove Centrifuge Tape from the Spin Plate and discard.

31. Add 100 µl of Solution C6 to the center of each well of the Spin Plate.  Apply Centrifuge Tape. Let C6 sit on the filter for 15 minutes at room temperature before final centrifugation step.

32. Centrifuge at room temperature for 7 minutes at 2500 x g.  Remove Centrifuge Tape and discard.

33. Cover wells of Microplate with the Elution Sealing Mat provided. DNA is now ready for any downstream application. No further steps are required. 

Prolonged storage at 4°C will result in the evaporation of eluted DNA. We recommend storing DNA frozen (-20°C or -80°C). Solution C6 does not contain EDTA.  To concentrate the DNA see the Hints and Troubleshooting Guide.






Important Considerations

1. Normal diameter 1 ml pipet tips are too large for some of the pitetting steps. To get around this problem we use a Rainin 300 ul 8-channel with filtered tips (Rainin #SR-L300F) and a Rainin 1000 ul 8-channel with extended length filtered tips (Rainin #RTS-L1000XF).

2. Make sure that all of the necessary consumables and reagents are in place before you start the extraction. Remember, each pipetting step will require 1 box of 96 tips per plate. 

3. We use individually wrapped reagent reservoirs and expose them to UV light for 30 minutes prior to usage.

4. In Step 7, it is important that the plate not rub against any surfaces in the shaker. 

5. Make sure that the alpha-numeric grid is in the same orientation across all the plates.  On a few occasions we have noticed that the sticker is not always in the same position on the plate.
